      This blog functions to record my activities while spending the majority of my summer working as an intern. From mid May to mid August of 2015, I will be devoting my time and effort as a Native Trout Conservation Intern at Yellowstone National Park, WY. This was made possible through the Student Conservation Association, as well as the National Park Service. I will be living inside the park in a cabin dorm and working 40 hrs a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main duties as a Native Trout Conservation Intern will be working to preserve Cutthroat Trout & Arctic Grayling populations, as well as removing populations of Lake Trout. I will be assisting Yellowstone Fisheries & Aquatic Sciences Biologists employed by the National Park Service doing various tasks, jobs, and activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      More information about the Yellowstone Fisheries & Aquatic sciences can be found <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/management/native-fish-conservation-program.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.

      For my first flight for this trip, I flew out of Flint, Michigan to Minneapolis, Minnesota. I had a 3 hour layover in a larger than expected airport where my gate changed and I was lucky enough to notice it. After waiting and a bit of wandering, I then flew to Bozeman, Montana. The plane rides aggravated my teeth, made my sinuses real angry, and made my slight head cold far worse. I spent my first 4 days here feeling miserable, and incredibly sickly. The Bozeman airport was very small, which made it easy to find my ride, but I hadnt prepared much to lug my two giant duffle bags and a day pack across a large parking lot. Oops! There was another intern being picked up, so we were dropped off at the grocery store to buy two weeks worth of food. I would find out later that I did not buy nearly enough food.
    </p>
    <p>
    I was dropped off at the fisheries office and finally got to meet my supervisor, Colleen. She is extremely nice, friendly, and very helpful. She helped me get my room, facilities, and fisheries key, and took me up to my dorm so I could unpack the 75+lbs of luggage I packed. I will not go into details, but I will say my dorm building is less than I expected and I am investing in cleaning supplies and mouse traps. But I'm going to make it work! I was so worn out and exhausted I barely got my things put away, and just went to sleep. I have limited signal and no internet at the dorm so trying to get any contact is extremely difficult.

      <p>I had to be ready to be picked up (oh yeah, not having a car here is dreadful) at 6 AM to head down to the Lake Office for orientation. My supervisor, NPS tech, and I are alone working out of Mammoth Hot Springs for the fisheries department, so there are no other fisheries interns in the North but me! Orientation was interesting and I got to meet the other interns and techs. Mainly, we just went over rules and some safety things, but my head cold, teeth, and jaw pain was getting to its worst. We got stuck at the Lake longer than we intended to, finally made the drive back north to Mammoth, and worked until 6pm loading and weighing items to be flown into the backcountry for the upcoming fisheries project I would be assisting on over the next few days. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Tuesday was the first day I ate somewhat decent of a meal since Sunday evening, using my backcountry pot to make mashed potatoes in the dorm kitchen. It is also important to note that here really are elk and bison EVERYWHERE in Mammoth and they are gigantic. Like, everywhere. You truly have to be incredibly careful to not walk up to one hidden around a corner!

      Happy Birthday Jake! Today marked the beginning of my first project as a fisheries intern. I was flying into the backcountry early in the morning. Wednesday I started at 630am and helped weigh and label ALL of the supplies that needed to be brought in on helicopter. There was a LOT of it. Six of us were flying into the backcountry, to Grayling Creek, to set up RSI’s for Grayling eggs. More about RSI’s later. Wednesday I also got officially checked in to the park and was assigned my NPS radio, which I will have extensive training in, eventually. I also finally got my bear spray and found a pair of waders and boots that (I thought) fit me. After a busy morning of loading and weighing gear, we drove to the helipad.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then got to work with Helitack to prepare swing loads to be carried into the backcountry (each load with a 900lb maximum). 2 sling loads were of backpacking gear and the rest were RSI setups and also loads of bags of gravel. The weather got bad so there was a bit of waiting, and unfortunately I had already lost cell phone signal.

    <h1>MAY 21 THURSDAY</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Before explaining what I did Thursday, I’ll explain why we were even there!
    </p>
    <p>Arctic Grayling fish were once native to Grayling Creek (imagine that) but were wiped out by invasive species. Last year the fisheries department removed the invasive fish using a piscicide. This year we were reintroducing the Arctic Grayling, but we had to build setups to do this. We could not just dump juvenile or adult Grayling into the creek because if we did, the fish would not home back to this creek to spawn. Instead we needed to build Remote Site Incubators (RSI’s) so the fish would consider this area as a true spawning area. Each RSI consists of a man-made damn, 50+ft of pipe, and an incubation tank constructed using two garbage cans, mesh, gravel, and biomedia (and eventually eggs!). Two RSI’s were put in at each site (we had 5 sites, so 10 RSI’s in total). The dams were necessary to create enough pressure to fill the cans downstream, as well as to provide flowing water thereafter. For the RSI to function, a constant flow of fresh water moving into the incubator is necessary (this is to keep the eggs alive). Once the eggs hatch inside the incubator and grow, they can swim upwards and swim out the exit valve at the top. If you just release eggs into a stream, they will certainly not survive. RSI’s basically mimic what a female fish would create for eggs in stream crevices and benthos. Eggs were obtained from a hatchery in Montana. I wish I could have seen that facility!
    </p>
    <p> Thursday we spent all day building RSI setups. I was the smallest and least experienced of everyone there. We first needed to build the dams necessary which was a true feat by itself. Tee posts were mashed into and across the stream, and the gravel bags were built up to create the dam. This was incredibly difficult, standing in the stream, in waders, in the cold and rain, shoving bags of gravel up against a strong current. Each gravel bag weighed 65lbs, and there were about 30(?) at each site. Let me remind you again, we were in the backcountry. Everything was done on foot. Once the dam was built up, we shoved the pvc pipes in place, which connected to the incubators, which were also tee posted into the stream bed. Each RSI took a few hours to set up, including fixing and rebuilding the dams and placement to ensure water flow. I was exhausted and felt useless because my arms just wouldn’t pick anything up anymore after the fourth RSI. I accidentally got my right arm soaked, so my 2 long sleeves, hoody, fleece, and rain jacket got soaked with cold water. (Which are still not dry, today). Once we finished the 5th site RSI, my hands were cut and ripped to shreds, a giant blister formed on my toe, my back, arms, and legs felt like all the muscles had been pulled. BUT, it was super cool to see everything starting to come together, and the scenery was beautiful. We didn’t get done until around 800. Thursday night I managed to make warm food, and we went to bed.

    <h1>MAY 22 FRIDAY</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
    <p>
      Friday I had to get up at 530am to pack up my personal gear, pad, sleeping bag, and tent since I was not staying out or coming back next week to the site. I woke up Friday to find my tent covered in frost, which was not enjoyable to dismantle to say the east. I was also relieved to not have been mauled in the night because I woke up every 2 hours. It was a very cold night, and I was wearing all the clothes I could that weren’t wet. I also ate my last bagel I had and hoped I would get back to my dorm by lunch time. We started at 8am and went to each RSI. The first one we went to failed and we had to redo the dam. Once that was fixed we added the gravel to the inside of the incubators to all 10 setups that were placed across the large meadow. I should note that the meadow was infested and populated with voles so everywhere you stepped, your wading boots sunk 4 inches into the dirt and mud. I discovered my boots were the wrong size and I am getting new ones next week :) It’s also difficult hiking across this muddy sinkhole, jumping across streams, and carrying bags while wearing giant waders. Around 11?, we heard the helicopter and went back to camp. The two other biologists flew in with the eggs! I was there for 4 of the installments of the eggs. The Grayling eggs were bright orange and already had two eyes formed, as little black dots. We went to the sites and for one of them I was asked to add the eggs to the RSI, which was really cool and made all the horrible grunt work worth it even more.
    </p>
    <p>
    My boss, tech, and I were  taken back to Mammoth in the helicopter with all of our personal gear. We went to the fisheries office.. I was then dropped off at my dorm. My supervisor then offered to take me to Gardiner to buy food and I had my first cup of coffee since Monday morning which was very satisfying. It's really difficult not having your own personal vehicle here. I bought a ton of food, cooking supplies, and a way to actually make coffee! Once I got back I unpacked from the backcountry, took a shower, and made spaghetti. 👍 I have a large amount of laundry to do, so I hope to find quarters soon. ( indeed I did find quarters)

  I slept in until 7. Got up and made my first cup of coffee here, which was just such a treat. It’s taken me 2 hours to write this all of this. Hopefully I will find wifi when I walk to Mammoth Hot Springs today and post this. Next week won’t be as labor intensive. I have Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and most of Tuesday off due to working overtime this week. Wednesday and Thursday will be 15 and 10 hour days devoted to wilderness first aid training!
  </p>
  <p>
  So, no free wifi in Mammoth. I am sitting in the hotel lobby paying for an hour of Internet. I walked from my dorm which was intimidating. Since I am starting to feel better health wise, and don’t feel like vomiting every minute from nerves, I was able to appreciate being surrounded by mountains. Hopefully I will also soon acclimate to being at 6500 feet soon, as well as accepting I am a stomach-dropping 1300 miles away from my comfort zone. Hopefully soon I will figure out a wifi/data solution so I have access to Internet, especially since my cellular signal in the dorm is unreliable. And hopefully soon I’ll have another blog post. 👍

    <h1>MAY 24 SUNDAY</h1>
    <p>
      I had Sunday off so I decided to explore Mammoth a bit more. The walk to and from Mammoth is a bit unnerving, since visibility on the walk isn’t that great, and I am in bear and bison territory. It only takes 20 min one way, but it’s still causes a good deal of anxiety since you’re alone. Bear spray will always be in hand. I checked out Mammoth Hot Springs a little, as well as some of the small tourist stores. The hot springs were really cool, and hopefully soon I’ll have more chances to check it out. It was cold, windy, and rainy, so I didn’t stay too long in Mammoth.

    <h1>MAY 25 MONDAY</h1>
    <p>
      I had today scheduled off due to Memorial Day. It was about 50F out, so I got the chance to read outside for a bit in the morning. 50 and sunny is lucky here at this time of year. It’s difficult to remember that it’s actually summer temps at home, where here it doesn’t get above 60 until mid June normally. I was asked to join a hike halfway up Bunsen Peak. The views were really nice, and it was quiet. You could also really smell everything around you. There so much pollution in cities. After we hiked back, I was able to get to the store and stocked up on peanut butter, since that’s the easiest protein source for me around here. Late Monday I got a call to find out I would be in the office all day Tuesday, so I was excited to find out what kind of stuff goes on in the Fisheries office on a normal day. I was also told that there was the possibility of going back into the backcountry Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to babysit the RSI’s from last week, which would have been pretty cool to monitor.

    <h1>MAY 26 TUESDAY</h1>
    <p>
      Tuesday started off easy. Spent the first hour of the day setting up my email for work and doing other things on the computer. I also got my schedule for Wilderness First Aid training and CPR training for Wednesday and Thursday. At around 830 am it was decided that I would be assisting in electro fishing at Pebble Creek. Pebble Creek is located in the Northeastern part of YNP, and technically we were in Montana. I was excited for that. I would be hiking in with three other people, and electro fishing for Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout that would be put in “live cars” to be used for spawning in the next few days (live cars are basically mesh boxes placed in the river that hold live fish). So, we packed up the truck with waders, boots, electro fishing backpack, personal gear, live cars, nets, and buckets. Roughly a, very pretty, 1.5-2 hour drive east led us to the Pebble Creek trailhead. With waders, boots, and a 30 lb backpack, I followed after the others on the trail. This was the snowiest, steepest, muddiest, narrow, insanely difficult, and cliff-riding trail I have ever been on in my entire life. It was also probably the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life, physically. The switchbacks never seemed to end. I had the stop every minute to catch my breath because I could no longer breath (really, I couldnt). My legs gave up, and my steps were reduced to only a few inches forward each time. I truly cannot describe the difficulty I had climbing this trail. I truly felt I would pass out on the trail. It took about 2 hours to climb. It then started raining and moments later started to hail. It was about 40 degrees and my clothes were soaked. Once we got to the top of the trail, we had to slide down snow to actually get to the creek. Every other step you took in the snow you either sunk down a foot and had to wrench your lower leg and foot out, or you just slid forward a foot and hoped friction would catch up with you. This was especially not easy for me, since I don’t have much mass to begin with, having a packed backpack on made me very unsteady. Once we finally got to the creek, I was absolutely exhausted. This didn’t help along with the fact that the stream was considerably strong due to some snowmelt. I had to fight my way upstream, with water at some points mid thigh, carrying an oversized backpack, trying to net fish as they were shocked up the stream. Unfortunately, we weren’t lucky and only managed to get about 12 fish. It was getting late in the day, so we started to head back. The climb down was, obviously, not nearly as difficult as the climb up. It was incredibly pretty, and I was able to appreciate where I was. I was also lucky enough to see two moose hanging out at the trailhead, which I was hoping I’d get to see even just one while I am here at Yellowstone. I didn’t get back to my dorm until about 630. A lot for an 11.5 hour work day.

    <h1>MAY 27 WENDESDAY</h1>
    <p> had to get up at 530 to get ready for my first aid class. I felt like I had gotten run over, broke my back, tore all the muscles in my legs, arms, and abs, and had a boulder sitting on my chest. But I still got up. 👍 I was dropped off to my first day of Wilderness First Aid, followed immediately by a CPR course. Wednesday, in total, was a 13.5 hour work day. Wilderness First Aid was interesting, but also felt a bit ridiculous since there was a lot of role playing and acting out scenarios with complete strangers. Everyone was very nice, and it went by somewhat quicker than I expected. I then immediately started CPR training, and after a 3 hour course, I passed my test. 🙂 By the end of the day I was even more sore, and just didn’t want to move. I was lucky enough to get a ride to my dorm. I quickly ate some food, and passed out. 
    </p>

    <h1>MAY 28 THURSDAY</h1>
    <p>
      Another 10 hour work day. I didn’t mind, it was loads easier than Tuesday. Thursday was full of Wilderness First Aid training, part 2. My back started to hurt even more, and I felt very winded all day. Part of this session of class included looking at injuries and various wounds on a slideshow. I had to fight against passing out. More awkward acting scenes out and getting pushed outside my comfort zone, but I got through it and kept up. I am now officially certified in CPR and in Wilderness First Aid! I was, again, lucky enough to get a ride from other fisheries people back to my dorm, ate some food, and just laid down. I was told I get Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off. I am really, really hoping that gives me time for my body to heal and get stronger again before the following work week. I really am still suffering greatly from the hike on Tuesday. I was also told I get to participate in radio training for park service employees on Monday, so I’m looking forward to that! More people have moved into the dorm and they’re all really nice. I also learned this was the last season they were using this housing. It’s likely to be demolished and rebuilt due to its age and condition.
    </p>

    <h1>MAY 29 FRIDAY</h1>
    <p>
      Today I got up at 630. Was nice to sleep in... The muscles in my body still hate me. I hope I can recover before next week. I still have no idea what I’ll be doing, but hopefully I can keep up whatever it is. I cleaned my room and made coffee. I believe I am going to Bozeman today with another girl from the dorm, hopefully finding some wifi so I can post this. I’ve been told by a few people I should be receiving care packages relatively soon from them, so that’s a very good feeling. I really like that is rains here at the dorm on and off all day. But, it would be nice if it warmed up to at least 70. Now I’m in Bozeman. It’s full of hipsters. EVERYWHERE. But wifi 👍
    </p>

    <h1>MAY 30 SATURDAY</h1>
    <p>
      Today I had the pleasure of sleeping in until 7. I had my coffee, sitting out on the front stoop this morning, it being nearly 60 out! Worked out a care package from home from my parents, so that should be fantastic to have when it arrives. We now have wifi setup for at the dorm, so that makes my life much easier, being able to access my messages, email, blog, and to pay my bills. Took a quick shower, and some people from the dorm and I traveled to see the Grand Prismatic Hot Spring. On a related note, it’s baffling that you can travel for 1.5+ hours and you don’t traverse much of the park. It’s gigantic. So much steam was coming off of the Hot Spring it became difficult to get a good view of the entire thing. I was able to get some pretty awesome pictures though. 👍 After we headed back north to Mammoth, we stopped and got real food. Very happy to have had the chance of having a cheeseburger two days in a row. I’m looking forward to a relaxing day tomorrow, before my next work week starts. Still not sure what my assignments will be, but my body is starting to feel less achy and sore, so I am in good spirits and feeling optimistic. It kind of rained here for a bit today, but I am definitely jealous of the heavy rains Rochester has gotten today for sure. Also, I hopefully should be able to post on this blog more than once a week, and will try to upload as many pictures I can fit.
